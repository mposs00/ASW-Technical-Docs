## About
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a central location for technical information related to games made by Arc System Works. The goal is to produce specifications of internal file formats through reverse engineering, and to implement these specifications in tools designed to interpret and manipulate game data, with the goal of both gaining more information about these games, as well as permitting the development of mods and enhancements.

## Structure
Top-level directories in this repo will exist for each game. These directories will contain sub-directories for specifications on file formats and game data structures, notes on reverse engineering and useful debugging information, and tools designed to parse and manipulate this data.
